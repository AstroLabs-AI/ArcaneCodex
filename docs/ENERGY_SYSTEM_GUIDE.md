# Quantum Energy System Guide

## Overview
The Quantum Energy System in Arcane Codex represents energy as a living, evolving force that responds to how it's used. Unlike traditional tech mod energy, quantum energy has personality, resonance, and can create cascading effects.

## Energy Types

### 1. Coherent Light (Cyan - 0x00FFFF)
- **Source**: Harvested during daytime from Quantum Harvesters
- **Properties**: Stable, predictable, good for basic operations
- **Best Uses**: Powering machines, basic reality manipulation
- **Resonance**: Increases with consistent usage patterns

### 2. Quantum Foam (Magenta - 0xFF00FF)
- **Source**: Harvested at night from Quantum Harvesters
- **Properties**: Chaotic, high potential, unpredictable
- **Best Uses**: Reality programming, dimensional operations
- **Resonance**: Fluctuates based on nearby energy types

### 3. Neural Charge (Purple - 0x9932CC)
- **Source**: Generated by Neural Interface, player proximity
- **Properties**: Consciousness-linked, grows with player
- **Best Uses**: Research, augmentations, consciousness expansion
- **Resonance**: Tied to player's consciousness level

### 4. Temporal Flux (Gold - 0xFFD700)
- **Source**: Time-based operations (coming soon)
- **Properties**: Affects time flow, degrades quickly
- **Best Uses**: Time manipulation, acceleration fields
- **Resonance**: Decreases over time, must be used quickly

### 5. Dark Current (Indigo - 0x4B0082)
- **Source**: Void operations, entropy (coming soon)
- **Properties**: Negative energy, consumes other types
- **Best Uses**: Defensive systems, reality anchoring
- **Resonance**: Inverse relationship with other energies

### 6. Synthesis Wave (Green - 0x00FF00)
- **Source**: Combining other energy types
- **Properties**: Hybrid energy, highly efficient
- **Best Uses**: Advanced crafting, synergy effects
- **Resonance**: Inherits properties from component energies

## Living Energy Mechanics

### Resonance System
- Energy resonance ranges from 0.5 to 2.0
- Higher resonance = more efficient operations
- Resonance changes based on:
  - Fill ratio of storage
  - Presence of other energy types
  - Usage patterns
  - Time since last interaction

### Resonance Cascades
When multiple energy types are present in the same storage:
- Cross-type interactions occur
- Can trigger beneficial cascades (efficiency boost)
- Or destructive interference (energy loss)
- Managed through careful balance

## Energy Network

### Quantum Conduits
- Auto-connect to adjacent energy blocks
- Balance energy levels between connected storages
- Small buffer prevents overflow
- Visual connections show network topology

### Transfer Mechanics
- Energy flows from high to low concentration
- Transfer rate affected by resonance
- Multiple energy types can flow simultaneously
- Priority system for different consumers

## Storage Guidelines

### Basic Storage (Quantum Harvester)
- Capacity: 100,000 units per type
- Good for single energy type focus
- Built-in resonance optimization

### Advanced Storage (Coming Soon)
- Quantum Batteries: High capacity, all types
- Resonance Chambers: Optimize specific combinations
- Void Capacitors: Store dark current safely

## Best Practices

### Early Game
1. Start with Coherent Light (day) harvesting
2. Add Quantum Foam (night) for variety
3. Use conduits to create simple networks
4. Monitor resonance with Quantum Scanner

### Mid Game
1. Set up Neural Interface for consciousness energy
2. Balance multiple energy types
3. Create resonance cascades intentionally
4. Use energy for Reality Programming

### Advanced Strategies
1. **Energy Mixing**: Combine types for Synthesis Wave
2. **Resonance Farming**: Maintain optimal fill ratios
3. **Network Topology**: Star vs mesh configurations
4. **Type Specialization**: Dedicate networks to specific types

## Troubleshooting

### Low Resonance
- Check fill ratio (50-75% is optimal)
- Ensure diverse energy types present
- Avoid rapid fill/drain cycles

### Energy Loss
- Look for dark current contamination
- Check for resonance conflicts
- Verify conduit connections

### Network Issues
- Use Quantum Scanner on conduits
- Ensure proper chunk loading
- Check for circular flows

## Energy Equations

### Resonance Calculation
```
Base Resonance = 0.5 + (Fill Ratio * 0.5)
Type Bonus = 0.1 * (Number of Other Types Present)
Final Resonance = Base + Type Bonus (max 2.0)
```

### Transfer Rate
```
Base Rate = 1000 units/tick
Modified Rate = Base * Source Resonance * 0.5
Final Rate = Modified * Distance Penalty
```

### Cascade Probability
```
P(cascade) = 0.1 * (Total Resonance / Number of Types)
Cascade Multiplier = 1.5 to 2.5 (random)
```

## Advanced Concepts

### Quantum Entanglement (Coming Soon)
- Link storages across dimensions
- Instant energy transfer
- Shared resonance states

### Energy Consciousness
- Energy develops preferences over time
- Can reject certain operations
- Responds to player's consciousness level

### Reality Cost
- Each reality manipulation has energy cost
- Cost scales with effect magnitude
- Some operations require specific energy types

## Tips & Tricks

1. **Dawn/Dusk Harvesting**: Best resonance during transitions
2. **Energy Cocktails**: Mix 3 types for optimal cascades
3. **Conduit Art**: Aesthetic networks can improve resonance
4. **Scanner Addiction**: Check everything, knowledge is power
5. **Neural Synergy**: Higher consciousness = better energy efficiency

Remember: Quantum energy is alive. Treat it with respect, and it will serve you well. Abuse it, and face the consequences of reality's revenge.
