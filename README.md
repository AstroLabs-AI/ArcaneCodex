A revolutionary Minecraft Forge mod (1.20.1) that reimagines magic through quantum physics and digital sorcery. Program reality itself through consciousness expansion and quantum manipulation.

## Current Status - ALPHA RELEASE v0.4.0
- âœ… Phase 1: Core quantum energy system, basic machines, and energy network
- âœ… Phase 2: Consciousness expansion, research tree, and augmentation system  
- âœ… Phase 3: Reality Programming Language (RPL) and reality manipulation
- âœ… Phase 4: Custom dimensions, stability mechanics, and dimensional travel

**All major systems are now implemented and functional!**
