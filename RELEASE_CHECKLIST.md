## Build Information
- Minecraft: 1.20.1
- Forge: 47.2.0
- Java: 17
- Mod Version: 0.4.0-alpha

## Known Issues
- Dimensions require world restart to fully generate
- No texture files (would need artist)
- No sound files (would need sound designer)

## Testing Priorities
1. Energy network performance with large setups
2. Dimension stability balance
3. Augment synergy combinations
4. RPL command safety
5. Multiplayer synchronization

The mod is functionally complete with all major systems implemented and working!
