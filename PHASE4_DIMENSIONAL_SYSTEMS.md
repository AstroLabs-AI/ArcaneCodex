# Phase 4 Completion Summary - Dimensional Systems

## Overview
Phase 4 introduces a complete dimensional system to ArcaneCodex, allowing players to create, explore, and manage custom dimensions through quantum compilation.

## Major Systems Implemented

### 1. Dimension Compiler Multiblock (7x7x7)
- **Dimension Compiler Core**: Central control block
- **Dimensional Frame**: Structural frame blocks
- **Dimensional Stabilizer**: Stability nodes for the structure
- Consumes Quantum Foam energy based on dimension complexity
- Creates dimensional rifts upon successful compilation

### 2. Dimension Code System
- **Parser**: Supports properties, biomes, and rules
- **Validator**: Checks safety and calculates complexity/energy cost
- **Properties Supported**:
  - NAME, SEED, GRAVITY, TIME_FLOW
  - TERRAIN_TYPE (10 types including FRACTAL, QUANTUM, CRYSTALLINE)
  - SKY_COLOR, FOG_COLOR, LIGHT_LEVEL
  - ENERGY_DENSITY, INSTABILITY
  - HAS_CEILING, HAS_SKYLIGHT

### 3. Dimension Generation
- **DimensionFactory**: Creates custom dimension types and chunk generators
- **DimensionManager**: Handles dimension creation, deletion, and persistence
- **Custom terrain generators** for each terrain type
- **Biome system** with custom colors and properties

### 4. Dimension Stability Mechanics
- **DimensionStabilityManager**: Tracks and updates dimension stability
- Stability decreases based on:
  - Base instability value
  - Player presence and count
  - Energy density
  - Time since creation
- **Instability Effects**:
  - Visual distortions (confusion effect)
  - Spatial distortions (random teleportation)
  - Energy drain (weakness effect)
  - Reality glitches spawn
- **Dimension Collapse**: Evacuates players when stability reaches 0

### 5. Dimensional Rifts
- **DimensionalRiftBlock**: Portal to custom dimensions
- Created automatically after dimension compilation
- Has its own stability that decays over time
- Teleports entities between dimensions
- Shows destination info when shift-clicked

### 6. Dimension Stabilizer Tool
- Consumes Neural Charge to boost dimension stability
- Shows current dimension stability in tooltip
- Crafted with quantum cores, neural matrix, and clock
- 100 durability

### 7. Predefined Dimensions

#### Data Stream
- Digital/cyber aesthetic with grid-like platforms
- Cyan/green color scheme
- Floating data platforms and vertical data streams
- No weather, always bright

#### Probability Garden  
- Surreal garden where probability waves collapse
- Purple/pink/rainbow color scheme
- Floating islands with crystalline structures
- Probability flux features that randomly change blocks

#### Time Echo
- Past, present, and future overlap
- Sepia/golden colors with temporal distortions
- Ancient structures and temporal anomalies
- Variable time flow

#### Null Space
- Empty void between dimensions
- Black/dark gray aesthetic
- Minimal floating platforms
- No natural light

## GUI Systems
- **DimensionCompilerScreen**: Full code editor with syntax highlighting
- Validate button for checking code
- Help system showing all available properties
- Real-time compilation progress
- Energy and stability display

## Integration Points
- Uses Quantum Foam energy for compilation
- Requires Neural Charge for stabilization
- Integrates with consciousness system
- Compatible with reality glitch system
- Particle effects maintain mod's aesthetic

## Technical Implementation
- Proper client-server packet system
- World-saved dimension data
- JSON-based predefined dimensions
- Custom chunk generators
- Stability saved per dimension

## Balance Considerations
- Energy cost scales with complexity
- High complexity dimensions are unstable
- Stability requires active maintenance
- Rifts eventually collapse
- Player presence affects stability

## Future Possibilities
- Dimension-specific resources
- Cross-dimensional energy networks
- Dimension merging/splitting
- Custom dimension events
- Programmable dimension rules

Phase 4 successfully implements a complete dimensional system that ties into the mod's "reality is code" theme, allowing players to literally program new realities!
