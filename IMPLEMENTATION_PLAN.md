### Data-Driven Content
- JSON schemas for augments
- Datapack support for custom energy types
- Configurable research trees
- Player-shareable dimension templates

### Performance Considerations
- Quantum calculations on worker threads
- Chunk-based reality manipulation
- Energy network optimization with caching
- LOD system for complex holograms
- Particle effect batching

## Development Priorities

1. **Core Loop First**: Energy generation → Research → Crafting
2. **Vertical Slice**: One complete progression path
3. **Multiplayer Early**: Design with sync in mind
4. **Iterate on Feel**: Quantum effects should feel powerful
5. **Community Features**: Shareable content systems

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for core systems
- Integration tests for energy networks
- Playtesting for progression balance
- Performance profiling for large bases
- Multiplayer stress testing
