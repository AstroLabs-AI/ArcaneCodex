# Development Session 2 - Phase 2 & 3 Completion

## Completed Tasks:

### 1. Extended Augmentation System
- Added 5 new augment types:
  - **Neural Link**: +50 Neural Charge capacity, enables quantum entanglement
  - **Temporal Sync**: +20% movement speed, temporal manipulation
  - **Quantum Core**: +100 Neural Charge, +50% energy resonance
  - **Phase Shift**: +2 hearts, phase through reality
  - **Dermal Plating**: +4 armor, +2 toughness
- Each augment targets different body slots for synergy bonuses
- Added crafting recipes and language entries
- Integrated with existing augment system

### 2. 3D Holographic Research Tree GUI
- Implemented `ResearchTreeScreen` with full 3D rendering:
  - Mouse drag to rotate view
  - Scroll wheel to zoom
  - Click nodes to select/unlock
  - Hovering shows research details
- Visual features:
  - Glowing synaptic links between connected research
  - Animated holographic nodes with state-based colors
  - Floating particle effects for atmosphere
  - Clean cyberpunk aesthetic with cyan/purple theme
- Integrated with Neural Interface block
- Shows consciousness level and neural charge

### 3. Reality Programming Language (RPL)
- Verified existing implementation:
  - Full parser with pattern matching
  - Command factory system
  - 5 working commands (gravity, phase, quantum measure, time dilation, energy cascade)
  - Reality Compiler block executes code from written books
  - Energy cost system for commands
  - Error handling and player feedback

### 4. Menu System Infrastructure
- Created `ModMenuTypes` registry
- Set up client-side screen registration
- Connected GUI to block entity interaction

## Technical Notes:
- Used proper Forge registration patterns
- Maintained separation of client/server code
- Followed existing mod architecture
- Preserved the "quantum consciousness" theme throughout

## Current Project Status:
- **Phase 1**: ✅ Complete (Core Foundation)
- **Phase 2**: ✅ Complete (Consciousness Systems)
- **Phase 3**: ✅ 90% Complete (Reality Manipulation - only missing RPL code editor GUI)
- **Phase 4**: Ready to begin (Dimensional Systems)

## Files Modified/Created:
- Created 5 augment classes
- Created ResearchTreeScreen and ResearchTreeMenu
- Created ModMenuTypes registry
- Updated ModItems with new augments
- Updated language file
- Added augment recipes
- Updated ClientSetup for GUI registration
- Updated ArcaneCodex main class
- Updated NeuralInterfaceBlockEntity to open GUI

## Next Steps:
1. Optional: Create RPL code editor GUI for Reality Compiler
2. Begin Phase 4: Dimensional Systems
3. Add more visual polish (shaders, better 3D shapes)
4. Implement research unlock network packets
5. Add sound effects for consciousness expansion
