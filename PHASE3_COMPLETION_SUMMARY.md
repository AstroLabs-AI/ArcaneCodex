# Phase 3 Completion Summary - Reality Manipulation

## Overview
Phase 3 is now complete! The mod now has a full reality manipulation system with quantum mechanics, temporal control, and probability manipulation.

## Major Additions

### 1. Reality Programming Language (RPL) - Enhanced
- **Code Editor GUI**: Full-featured editor with syntax highlighting and help
- **Network Integration**: Client-server packet system for code execution
- **Live Output**: Real-time feedback and error messages
- **Help System**: Built-in command reference

### 2. Quantum Entanglement System
- **Quantum Entangler Tool**: Links two blocks across space
- **Persistent Connections**: Saved across world reloads
- **Coherence Decay**: Entanglement weakens over time and distance
- **Visual Feedback**: Particle effects show connection strength
- **Manager System**: Server-side tracking of all entanglements

### 3. Reality Glitch Generation
- **Glitch Types**:
  - Gravity Inversion: Reverses gravity in an area
  - Temporal Stutter: Causes entities to jump back in time
  - Block Phasing: Makes blocks temporarily non-solid
  - Dimensional Tear: Creates unstable space with random effects
- **Dynamic Duration**: Glitches last 5-20 seconds
- **Intensity System**: Stronger glitches have wider effects
- **Particle Effects**: Unique visuals for each glitch type

### 4. Temporal Mechanics
- **Temporal Stabilizer Block**: 
  - Controls time flow in an area
  - Generates chronocharge resource
  - Records temporal echoes of entities
  - Time dilation/acceleration field
- **Temporal Echo System**:
  - Records entity states
  - Creates ghostly replays
  - Limited to 5 echoes to prevent lag
- **Chronocharge**: New resource for temporal manipulation

### 5. Probability Manipulation
- **Probability Manipulator Tool**:
  - Charge-based activation
  - Multiple random effects:
    - Lucky Drops: Duplicates items
    - Critical Enhancement: Improves projectiles
    - Experience Burst: Spawns XP orbs
    - Quantum Tunneling: Random teleportation
    - Entropic Cascade: Shuffles blocks
  - Special interaction with stone (transmutation to ore)
- **Neural Charge Integration**: Uses consciousness system

## Technical Implementation

### New Systems
1. **Quantum Entanglement Manager**: World-saved data for persistent connections
2. **Reality Glitch Manager**: Server-side glitch tracking and effects
3. **Temporal Echo**: Entity state recording and replay
4. **Network Packets**: ExecuteRPLPacket for code execution

### New Blocks
- **Temporal Stabilizer**: Time manipulation machine
- **Reality Compiler** (enhanced): Now has full GUI

### New Items
- **Quantum Entangler**: Creates quantum connections
- **Probability Manipulator**: Collapses probability waves

### GUI Systems
- **Reality Compiler Screen**: Code editor with syntax help
- **Menu System**: Proper container menus for all machines

## Integration Points
- All new items use the consciousness system
- Quantum energy powers all machines
- Particle effects maintain visual consistency
- Language entries for all new content

## Balance Considerations
- Temporal effects require significant energy
- Probability manipulation has cooldowns
- Entanglement decays naturally
- Reality glitches are temporary

## Future Expansion Possibilities
- More RPL commands
- Additional glitch types
- Temporal paradox mechanics
- Probability-based crafting
- Entanglement-based teleportation

Phase 3 brings the "reality is code" concept to life with manipulable physics, time control, and quantum probability!
