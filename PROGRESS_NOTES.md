# Arcane Codex Progress Notes

## Core Systems Implementation

### What's Working
- ✅ Basic mod structure with proper package organization
- ✅ Quantum Energy System with 6 unique energy types
- ✅ Living energy mechanics (resonance changes based on usage)
- ✅ Player consciousness capability tracking
- ✅ Quantum Harvester generating energy based on environment
- ✅ Quantum Scanner for diagnostics
- ✅ Neural Interface for consciousness expansion
- ✅ Quantum Conduits for energy networking
- ✅ Nano-Multitool with consciousness bonuses
- ✅ Basic augment system with 2 starter augments
- ✅ Creative tab and basic recipes

### Architecture Decisions

1. **Energy as Living System**
   - Energy resonance changes dynamically
   - Cross-type interactions create cascades
   - Storage affects behavior patterns

2. **Consciousness Integration**
   - Player capability stores all progression
   - Augment slots map to body regions
   - Synergy system rewards combinations

3. **Modular Design**
   - Clean API interfaces for extensions
   - Capability-based for compatibility
   - Data-driven where possible

### Technical Challenges Solved

1. **Multi-Type Energy Storage**
   - EnumMap for efficient type tracking
   - Separate max values per type
   - NBT serialization preserving all states

2. **Block Entity Networking**
   - Auto-output to adjacent blocks
   - Direction-aware connections
   - Efficient tick-based transfers

3. **Conduit Connections**
   - Dynamic shape based on connections
   - Proper waterlogging support
   - Cached connection lookups

4. **Augment System**
   - Abstract base class for easy extension
   - Slot-based installation
   - Synergy calculations

### Current State
The mod now has a functional energy generation, storage, and consciousness system. Players can:
1. Craft tools and machines
2. Generate and transport quantum energy
3. Expand consciousness through Neural Interface
4. Install augments for permanent bonuses
5. Use tools that scale with consciousness

### Phase 1 Completion Status

  - ✅ Memory fragment functionality
  - ⏳ 3D holographic GUI (needs implementation)

- ✅ 2.2 Player Augmentation (70%)
  - ✅ Augment slot system
  - ✅ Basic augments (Cortex, Optic)
  - ✅ Synergy calculations
  - ✅ Augmentation table multiblock
  - ⏳ More augment types needed

- ✅ 2.3 Consciousness Capabilities (100%)
  - ✅ Player data persistence
  - ✅ Research progress tracking
  - ✅ Augment installation
  - ✅ Event handling

### Additional Completed
- ✅ Particle system foundation
  - Quantum energy particles
  - Neural spark particles
  - Holographic particles
  - Reality glitch effects
- ✅ Visual feedback for active machines

### Design Philosophy Maintained
- ✨ "Where quantum physics meets digital sorcery"
- 🔮 Energy feels alive and responsive
- 🧠 Consciousness drives progression
- 🌌 Reality is malleable code
- 🔗 Everything connects and synergizes

### Notes for Next Session
- Research tree needs custom 3D rendering
- Consider using capability syncing for multiplayer
- Particle system should reflect energy types
- GUI work will be substantial for neural interface
- Need to implement Reality Programming Language parser
