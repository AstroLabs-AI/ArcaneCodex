# ArcaneCodex - Complete Mod Summary

## Overview
ArcaneCodex is a revolutionary Minecraft Forge mod (1.20.1) that reimagines magic through the lens of quantum physics and digital sorcery. Players manipulate reality through code, consciousness, and quantum energy.

## Core Philosophy
"Reality is code, consciousness is the compiler, and you are the programmer."

## Major Systems

### 1. Quantum Energy System
- **Six Energy Types**: Coherent Light, Quantum Foam, Neural Charge, Temporal Flux, Dark Current, Synthesis Wave
- **Living Energy**: Evolves based on usage patterns and resonance
- **Energy Network**: Quantum conduits with phase states and resonance cascades
- **Harvesting**: Quantum Harvesters extract energy from the quantum field

### 2. Consciousness System
- **Neural Interface**: Gateway to expanded consciousness
- **3D Research Tree**: Holographic visualization of knowledge
- **Player Augmentation**: 12 augments across 6 body slots
- **Synergy Effects**: Augment combinations unlock special abilities
- **Consciousness Levels**: Progress through quantum enlightenment

### 3. Reality Programming Language (RPL)
- **Custom Language**: Write code to manipulate reality
- **Reality Compiler Block**: Execute RPL programs
- **Commands**: gravity, phase, quantum_measure, time_dilation, energy_cascade
- **Energy Cost**: Each command consumes quantum energy
- **Visual Feedback**: Real-time execution effects

### 4. Dimensional Systems
- **Dimension Compiler**: 7x7x7 multiblock for creating dimensions
- **Dimension Code**: Custom syntax for defining dimension properties
- **Stability Mechanics**: Dimensions decay and require maintenance
- **Dimensional Rifts**: Portals to custom dimensions
- **Predefined Dimensions**: Data Stream, Probability Garden, Time Echo, Null Space

### 5. Advanced Tools & Machines
- **Nano-Multitool**: Adaptive tool that changes based on target
- **Quantum Scanner**: Analyzes quantum signatures
- **Quantum Entangler**: Creates quantum connections between blocks
- **Probability Manipulator**: Collapses probability waves for random effects
- **Temporal Stabilizer**: Controls time flow in an area
- **Augmentation Table**: Install and manage player augments

### 6. Reality Manipulation
- **Quantum Entanglement**: Link blocks across space
- **Reality Glitches**: Random anomalies with unique effects
- **Temporal Echoes**: Record and replay entity states
- **Probability Fields**: Areas of quantum uncertainty
